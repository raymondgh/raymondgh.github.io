<strong>Challenge</strong>
<p>In 2011, I got hooked on an online game with some friends, new and old. Die2Nite's premise of collaborative survival pits 40 players against waves of zombies in a text-based resource-gathering & tower defense scenario. For me, the fun of the game came from working with each other to manage resources and action points in order to maximize survival. How could I make the game more fun and less tedious for my team while improving our competitive capacity?
</p>
<strong>Solution</strong>
<p>LAtlas is an overworld visualization tool that organizes information collected by players as they explore the areas in the game. We built Atlas with the constraints of a world-wide audience: players with varied native languages, low-resolution displays, and a full range of time zones to account for. Atlas accepted data in 3 formats: an official, game-provided XML feed that updated every 90 seconds, a 3rd party data-scraping tool, and manual user input. As the de facto product manager, I was primarily responsible for determining the business logic for interpreting data and the visual and interactive design for displaying it. We iterated on the product at various levels of intensity over the course of a year, adding features like real-time updates, historical data analysis, map drawings and annotations, and custom data fields. In parallel, we developed a simple calculator to help players with resource management called "Day of Dehydration" which explains the value of various construction options in terms of survival days. Our clan went on to rank among the top teams worldwide and years after the Die2Nite community has dwindled, many of us remain friends both online and offline.
