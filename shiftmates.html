<strong>Challenge</strong>
<p>After moving to San Francisco in 2014 without a job lined up, I found myself living off hackathon winnings with new friends in the city. Eventually a core team of three emerged as good at "getting shit done." We soon won a significant cash prize at a Capital One hackathon, and with that validation, decided we wanted to continue building the idea of Shiftmates into a company.</p>
<strong>Solution</strong>
<p>Shiftmates is a web application that lets employees and managers drop, trade, and request working shifts. As the CEO, I led the team with the dream of freeing the part-time worker from the risks of inconsistent work and lack of career mobility. We wanted to bring the employment flexibility of Uber and the security of wage-based work together in a way that didn't suffer the same profitability problems as the rest of the gig-economy. The ideal target customer was an organization that needed work done by a pool of interchangeable employees such as nurses, wait staff, firemen, most student-employment, and volunteers. To eliminate the pain of taking photos of sloppy excel sheets and dialing down favorite coworkers to beg to have a shift covered, we built a myriad of features. We designed a fully-SMS interface, a click-and-drag GUI for scheduling shifts, a shift-swap approval system for managers, and even a time-clock hourly tracker for Wix websites. We tried marketing to small businesses through cold calling, door-to-door canvasing, email solicitations, referrals, and even physical flyers. We applied to a couple incubators and interviewed at Y Combinator, but decided not to put additional effort toward fundraising without more significant traction. Ultimately, we failed to find a product-market fit before running out of financial runway. Interestingly, in the time since we called it quits, we've seen a half-dozen other startups raise funds and subsequently shut down in attempt to solve the same problems.
