<strong>Challenge</strong>
<p>When a developer challenge by the Stellar Development Foundation coincided with my growing interest in cryptocurrency, my friend and I decided to compete in the Stellar Build Challenge to improve the Stellar cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<strong>Solution</strong>
<p>AutoXLM provides a familiar Email/Password system for everyday people to get involved with Stellar. Each account is assigned a unique Zapier integration token which can be used to create integrations between services connected to the Zapier platform. This allows commonly known applications like Gmail, Slack, Quickbooks, Salesforce, and many more to trigger AutoXLM to send Stellar Lumens automatically.

For example, a remittance payment could be scheduled to send every two weeks without a single line of code. An email from a relative could trigger a lovely gift. Automatic investments in digital assets could be made based on sales processed through Stripe.
