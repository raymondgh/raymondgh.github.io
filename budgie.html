<strong>Challenge</strong>
<p>For years, I've managed a monthly personal spending budget by breaking it down into a daily allowance. I found that by rolling over my unusued allowance for the day, I could allow myself to spend on wants within a reasonable limit and entirely free of guilt. In 2015, a hackathon provided the opportunity to get paid to automate this.</p>
<strong>Solution</strong>
<p>Budgie is a very simple daily budget app that gives a daily allowance and an expense tracking mechanism. There's intentionally no connection with any banks or APIs as the main benefit of the application is its habit-forming tedium that forces users to review their budget before making purchases. We built Budgie as a hybrid native app using Ionic beta to build app bundles and a free Parse instance to handle the database and backend. We released a few updates on Android and iOS in response to requests for more currencies and some bug fixes. We never did much to promote the app, but nevertheless ended up with over 1,000 downloads and 600 registered users, including a few strangers who really loved it. Unfortunately, both the Ionic Beta and Parse service shut down, ending the life of the app indefinitely. Don't tell Apple though, it's still available for download in the App Store.
