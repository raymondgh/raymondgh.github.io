<strong>Challenge</strong>
<p>In 2011 and 2012, Microsoft's new design language for Windows 8 (formerly known as Metro UI) presented an exciting platform for new developers to access a wide market of users. To seize the opportunity, we needed to be first movers. What could we build?</p>
<strong>Solution</strong>
<p>World Flags 2.0 is an educational game in flashcard format that effectively teaches users the national flags of the world. The inspiration came from a game I once played to study for a high school French exam. We developed World Flags 2.0 as a single page application, which was a style still gaining popularity at the time. We were successfully able to launch to English audiences within a few weeks of Windows 8's general availability. As time went on and our downloads climbed, we localized the game in 8 other languages, boosting our popularity even further. After 10 months of accelerating growth and top category rankings in a few markets, we decided to test monetization with a price point of $1.49. Two months and $22.38 in revenue later, we opted not to renew our Windows 8 developer license and the app was removed from the store. Fun trivia: we added the "2.0" to the title of our app because someone had already reserved the simple name "World Flags." A great memory from this project is a negative review from a Chinese user who insisted that we update the game to exclude Taiwan as a country.</p>
